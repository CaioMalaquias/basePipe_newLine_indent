Construct fast-smooth pipe chains in RStudio!

Two RStudio addins that allow you to assign a keyboard shortcuts to:

* `<space if needed> <- <newline><indent>`
* `<space if needed> %>% <newline><indent>`

I'm still experiemnting with the best key combos. I suggest `CTRL ,` and `CTRL .` respectively (by analogy to `<` and `>`).

Enjoy. :)
